Wagle tells that he is writing about Drishya who is an artist living in Kathmandu and has an ambitious idea to build a cafe in his village during the time when civil war is still going on. While waiting he learns that Drishya is kidnapped by \"security personnel\". Learning that the protagonist of his book has just been kidnapped, he is stunned and starts to contemplate his fate and the fate of Nepal.<br>The story of Drishya starts in Goa where he meets Palpasa, a Nepalese girl aspiring to become a documentary maker who has just returned from US. They have immediate connection but they both decide go their own way. Drishya returns to Kathmandu where he continues his art work in his studio. He reaches a small library with collection of old books for research where he meets Palpasa again. They both start meeting together and the attraction is undeniable.<br>Later Drishya is visited by Siddhartha, his friend from college. Siddhartha says that he is a Maoist in hiding and asks for shelter. He invites him in and they start talking about the state of Nepal. Drishya asks if the violence is justified even if their cause is good and Siddhartha replies that the violence was first started by the state and all the violence is justifiable for the greater good. They can't reach to an agreement so Siddhartha challenges Drishya to \"see\" what Nepal is like. Drishya accepts and then visits the western hill villages.<br>He meets a girl who is about to join Maoist on Siddhartha's insistence that she is going to become part of greater revolution. On reaching his village he meets Laure Kaka whose daughter is now a Maoist fighter and he doesn't know where his son is. Kaka tells him how his village could be made prosperous and he himself is farming coffee. He leaves the village and shares the walk with some foreigners who have built a school on his way to district headquarter. There he stays in a lodge and almost dies in a Maoist attack. He leaves the next day to go to his Mit's home where he learns that he has died and his Mitba and Mitama don't want him around as he reminds of their son.<br>Then he decides to return to Kathmandu as he has \"understood his country\" but wants to meet Siddhartha before he returns but mistakenly causes Siddhartha's death by pointing him out. Guilt ridden Drishya catches a bus back to Kathmandu where he finds Palpasa by his side who is also on her way back after her attempt to make documentary. Then both are glad that they met each other and try to talk about his abrupt leave from Kathmandu and the journey both of them had after that. Palpasa is killed in the bus explosion which Drishya survives as he had stepped outside.<br>Drishya returns to Kathmandu but is haunted by Palpasa for a long time. He starts painting a series of paintings titled Palpasa which helps him get some peace. He then continues in his life as an artist running with the dream to go back to his village to build the 'Palpasa Cafe'. Some people who claim to be security personnel come to visit him and force him to go along with them and his story ends there.<br>In the epilogue, Wagle has just completed his book.

The book is one of the best selling Nepalese novels.<br><b>Synopsis</b><br>The novel depicts the father-son relationship in a family from the Mid-western region of Nepal. The family had descended from Surkhet to the plains around present Bardiya National Park when the forest lands had opened up to agriculture, and then moved to Kalikot.<br>Brisha Bahadur, the narrator of the novel, is born into a Pahari family. They are one of the hill people families, who have been moving down to the plains in growing numbers over the past fifty years to open up newly cleared forest lands for agriculture. Brisha Bahadur's family belongs to this community, which dominates local commerce, trade and politics and forms a majority in the small bazaar towns of the district.<br>The story of Brisha's childhood is intertwined with a parallel story that begins with Brisha's father's admission into a hospital when Brisha is a teenager. Brisha Bahadur narrates his father's struggles. The novel is divided into eleven days. Brisha Bahadur is taking care of his father who is sick in those eleven days and he reminisces his past with his parents.<br>The novel is loosely modelled after Buddhi's own childhood, which passed in the same municipalities, although with different circumstances.

It was the author's first and most successful novel. It was awarded the Madan Puraskar in 1965.<br><b>Synopsis</b><br>Born in an affluent family in Darjeeling, Parijat moved to Kathmandu and pursued her studies in English literature. According to her, having studied many French, Russian and Indian novels in particular, she found herself very disappointed with Nepali novels. Therefore, despite having started out as a poet, she resolved to produce an exceptional Nepali language novel. She wrote four novels while she was studying for her I.A. and B.A. degrees, all of which she burned off. Then, she became bed-ridden with illness for three years, and wrote her fifth novel Shirishko Phool in that period, which she chose to publish. Shankar Lamichhane, a prominent writer and litterateur wrote the foreword for the novel.<br><b>Synopsis</b><br>Suyog meets Sakambari and her two sisters through Shivaraj. Suyog is a lonely middle-aged man and sees the three sisters with eyes of lust. He views Mujura as the quintessential woman with all the feminine virtues and the most logical choice for a wife. However, he is drawn towards Sakambari who is a rebellious personality who does not adhere to the traditional expectations of how a woman should act or dress. He finds his philosophies strongly at odds with Sakambari's and their acquaintance leads him to reevaluate his past life and actions. He comes to accept his acts such as the rape of three women he committed during the war, which he had previously rationalised as acceptable under the peril of immediate death both he and his victims were under at the time, as criminal. Suyog finds himself unable to continue without love or redemption. Reasoning that either Bari will accept him and he will have happiness or she will hurt or kill him for the transgression giving him redemption, Suyog gets hold of her and kisses her. However, Bari simply looks deeply into him and strides off, vanishing into the house. Suyog is left distraught and confused. Months after the incident, he finds out that Sakambari has died.",

It tells the story of love and separation between a young man who came to the city from a village and a young woman who came to Nepal from Germany. Although a novel based on love, Ojhel depicts the problems of Haliya and Kamaiya in western Nepal from the depiction of social norms and conflict. The problem of suffering has become readable as this novel speaks. Although it is a love novel, it is connected to society.<br>The novel discusses the plight of a young man who enters the city from a village with a dream, depicts political anarchy, and the exploitation of women accused of witchcraft. There is also a depiction of the conflict-era events and their impact on Nepali society. As the event of Prithvinarayan Shah's unification is depicted, this work also tries to show the historical information easily and clearly. In this novel, depiction of nature, figurative presentation, simplicity of language, subject matter have come easily. This book has managed to be very close to life.",

            "description": "Dedicated to those who love is a crazy lover's book - 'Unica' novel. This is the first narrative work of Ghanshyam Pathik, a poet and ghazal writer who has made a name for himself in the field of poetry and ghazal. Two collections of ghazals, 'Shahar Timro Bhaye' and 'Bhool Zindagi Ko' and a collection of poems 'Pahelo Phool O Swapna' are the works published before Pathik's novel. Pathik Damak, who is also involved in teaching along with literature, is also a presenter of Pathibhara FM and Himashikhar Television in Jhapa. <br>The cover of the book is decorated with a picture of a yellow bird flying on a branch of a thorn - by the Fine Art Center. The entire novel, which is divided into 32 parts, has only 258 pages and the last two pages express gratitude on behalf of the author.<br>Inside the last cover is a brief introduction with a picture of the author. Entering the novel, there is another novel within the novel. The author has become a reader and is reading Unika's novel, which has been announced to be awarded the Madan Award. Some works are in the news for a few days after they are published, and some are sold out and sold out. When a work is awarded a prestigious prize, it gains market share and readership. At the beginning of this story I present the character as a reader.<br>As the character I announced the Madan Award for Unika's novel, he decides to read it because the work is popular and starts reading it. In the middle of the story, the love story of Unika and Samik is presented. The beginning of the story is composed in the Purvadipti method and after twenty-eight episodes, the story is re-arranged and moved forward. Seen in this way, it seems that this novel has been composed in a mixed format. The original story is in the middle. Dedicated to those who love, it is easy to understand that this work is based on a love story. In the sixties, when the development of social media was not as fast as it is now and the exchange of messages and phone conversations between boyfriends and girlfriends through mobile phones, the situation of that time is also reflected in the story.<br>The author has advanced the ups and downs of love in a series of ways. In the middle of the story, he has also inserted his ghazal personality according to the context - by mentioning the lions of ghazal. The author presents the moment of reunion and separation in a way that makes the reader happy and sad. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a popular novel and its real author is a friend of Samik, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. In the novel, Unika is the main female character and Samik is the main male character. Their love is connecting and breaking up three times. After falling in love for the third time, Samik left the capital and reached Jhapa and started living a well-organized life in Jhapa. Between Unika and Samik, sometimes the landlord, sometimes the younger (Unika's sister) seems to be present. After going to Jhapa, the love of Unika and Samik grows once again. They get ready to get married and when the father does not approve of the marriage, the love breaks down again. In this way, both the characters seem to be accepting the ups and downs of reunion and separation with the situation. In the end, Samik arrives in Kathmandu to fight the last battle for his love. After many attempts to talk to Unika but failed, the story ends with Unika's flower being with another boy that Unika likes.<br>In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a famous novel and its real author is a friend of Samik's, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. Originally written from a first-person perspective, the language of the novel is very simple and communicative. Although the work is called 'Buckpatra of a mad lover', it is not only Samik's one-sided presentation here, a lot of things have been said about him through Unika, but also an attempt has been made to present Unika's thoughts a little through the entrance. But what did she really think on behalf of Unica in this love story? Why play such a game? As it is incomplete, it is limited to one-sided expression. Here it seems that the author has not been able to present both the characters with justice. The surroundings of this story are Maiti Devi, Ghattekulo, Kalimati, Kuleshwor, Swayambhu, Balaju, Godavari, etc. of Kathmandu, while Birtamod and Charali of Jhapa are also included. It seems that the lifestyle of the youths living and studying in Kathmandu is also tried to be included in this story. Although there is no explanation of the wholeness of life, this work has got the full form of the novel. ",

            "description": "When Erika read the story to the King, he cried out, \u201cBut that is I, Erika! And that is you!\u201d The King asked if he might keep the story and Erika said, \u201cIt was written for you, but I promise you, one day the whole world will know.\u201dThe king is King Tribhuvan. Erika is Erika Leuchtag, a German physiotherapist. The story is the book With a King in the Clouds which came out in 1958, and a later edition titled Erika and the King published by Coward-McCann Inc.<br>The book is an intimate history of King Tribhuvan during Nepal\u2019s political transition, his queens Kanti and Ishwari and the princesses Nalini, Vijaya and Bharati, who were not allowed to leave the Narayanhiti Palace by Nepal\u2019s Rana rulers.<br>The 270-page memoir begins on Christmas Eve in 1948 when Erika receives a letter from a European doctor, asking if she would be prepared to be a masseur for the Senior Queen of Nepal, who was then staying in the household of the royal family of Patiala in India. <br>Despite her family and friends advising her against venturing out to what was then a forbidden Himalayan kingdom, Erika entered Nepal in Feburary 1949 and walked up across Chandragiri pass to Kathmandu with her helper Gorkhi Ram and her spaniel dog, Peepchen.<p>Erika did not have a clue about the Shah-Rana dynamics of Nepal\u2019s two royal families until she sensed something was \u2018off\u2019 when she visited Singha Darbar \u2013 \u2018a prototype of the Palace of Versailles\u2019 -- to meet the last Rana Prime Minister Mohan Shumsher and the Director-General of Foreign Affairs, Bijaya Shumsher.<p>The British had left India, and an Anglophile Rana dynasty\u2019s days were numbered. There were new rulers in Delhi, and many members of Nepal\u2019s royal families and of India\u2019s princely states were married to each other. Palace intrigue, royal rivalries, and geopolitics were churning, and Erika changed from what the Ranas saw as a ditzy European woman to an insider playing an integral part in helping Tribhuvan\u2019s escape to India and the eventual end of Rana rule.<p>Her daily visits to the \u2018Naran Hity Durbar\u2019 was ostensibly to serve Senior Queen Kanti Rajya Lakshmi, but she ended up befriending the entire family, particularly King Tribhuvan. She was not just a physiotherapist for them, but a teacher, a Western dance instructor and a German language tutor.<br>She nicknamed the two queens Kanti and Ishwari \u2018Birdy\u2019 and \u2018Dreamy\u2019 for their beauty and personalities, but one gets hints of a growing intimacy with Tribhuvan. Erika Leuchtag herself left Germany before the war because of the rise of Adolf Hitler, and she makes no secret of the fact that the Ranas reminded her of the Nazis, and the Shahs were therefore allies.<br>Historian Dinesh Raj Panta remembers reading a smuggled copy of the first edition of Leuchtag\u2019s book in secrecy because it was banned, ironically, after the Shahs came to power. As a historian, Panta was intrigued by the German\u2019s relationship with Tribhuvan, his escape to the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu, departure to Delhi, and the events that followed.<br>\u201cWas she in love with Tribhuvan? Or was it just loyal devotion towards the king? Maybe the book was banned because people might think that the king\u2019s father had a romantic alliance with a European woman and that would taint the history of the restoration of the Shah dynasty,\u201d Panta speculates.<br>Rajni Chand, the granddaughter of King Tribhuvan and daughter of Princess Nalini, was brought up in Happy Cottage inside Narayanhiti since she was two by both her grandmothers \u2013Queens Kanti and Ishwari. Now 64 and living in Chhauni, she remembers her grannies talk about Erika and how everything changed after she arrived in Kathmandu.<br>It was not just Erika who was devoted to the family. Chand remembers being told the royal family was also extremely fond of her. They even named the room when she taught them to waltz the Erika Dance Hall in her honour. As a child, Chand remembers sneaking into the hall every chance she got to admire the colourful walls, the decoration and cute animal toys.<br>\u201cMy grandparents, mother and aunts were prisoners in the palace, and Erika was like a ray of sunshine in their lives, someone who they never imagined would help them recover from their miseries, and even in that short time, Erika managed to leave long-lasting memories for each one of them,\u201d Chand told us in an interview last week. <br>Unlike many history books about Nepal\u2019s longest reigning king, Erika gives us an insider\u2019s personal perspective on the man, describing vividly his melancholy and frustration at being a mere pawn at the hands of five Rana prime ministers: Chandra Shumsher, Bhim Shumsher, Juddha Shumsher, Padma Shumsher and Mohan Shumsher.<br>Perhaps it is because of Erika\u2019s influence that Tribhuvan confides that he wished to become a constitutional monarch like King George V of England. Which happened briefly during the transition in the 1950s, until his son King Mahendra took back absolute powers in 1961.<br>King Tribhuvan worked alongside Dharma Bhakta Mathema and other Nepali democracy activists politicians, but the book\u2019s more revealing parts are about the softer side of the man who loved and respected his wives and daughters, and who reciprocated the love.  <br>The King and his family lived in Happy Cottage, which was later known as Tribhuvan Sadan inside Narayanhiti Palace. As a royal prisoner, the king\u2019s life was like that of a bird in a gilded cage. He was intrigued by Europe, and often pored over mail-catalogues for clothes, furniture and cars to order for the palace. The book describes Tribhuvan as a man of sophistication who yearned to visit the outside world.<br>Tribhuvan was childlike, and according to Erika he never liked alcohol \u2013 mainly because he did not want to be a puppet king spoilt by wine and women like his father and grandfather. He was fond of cigars, dressed well, and once smuggled two trunks full of books from India through Boris Lissanevitch, the White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who managed Royal Hotel.<br>The book is a time capsule and through Erika\u2019s keen sense of observation, we get descriptions of Narayanhiti\u2019s majestic gardens and detailed portrayals of people she came across. The book is necessarily dated and in places turgid when she is describing the sights and sounds of Kathmandu, but one has to understand that this was one of the first books introducing Nepal to the outside world.<br>There are hints that Erika was more than a royal physiotherapist, she mentions walking hand-in-hand with the Tribhuvan around the palace garden. It is clear that she and Tribhuvan were working together to overthrow the Ranas, and in this she became the go-between to coordinate logistics with Indian ambassadors Surjit Singh Majithia (1947-49) and CPN Singh (1949-52).<br>She and Tribhuvan developed elaborate code words in their communications to keep their plans a secret. Here were some of them:<br>Serpent - A Rana<br>Big Snake - Prime Minister Mohan Shumsher<br>Bird - Ambassador<br>Moor - The King<br>Flower - Letter<br>Kite - Airplane<br>Storm \u2013 Evacuation<br>Erika - Lakshmi<br>Erika and the King, is now available as an e-book in English translation and is a timeless historical read. This is a fairy-tale account of that period, but it is accurate and does not exaggerate her own influence.<br>Rajni Chand (pictured left) notes that Erika's account and the oral history that she grew up with in the Shah royal family do match quite a bit. Chand admits she admired and respected Erika, probably also because the book mentions her grandmothers, mother and aunts in loving terms. That is the other unique part of this book -- very few historical accounts in Nepal ever mention the women behind the scenes, and if they do the female protagonists are often portrayed as power-hungry and ruthless.<br>The book concludes with King Tribhuvan\u2019s death in a hospital in Zurich, and as Dinesh Raj Panta notes, leaves open an interpretation about why Erika did so much for a country that would have never recognised her efforts.<br>Even 62 years after its first publication, Erika and the King is a fascinating insider account of Nepal\u2019s royal family through the eyes of a foreigner. It also re-introduces us to Erika Leuchtag, who seems to have played an important role in the escape of Tribhuvan and his family in 1950 to the Indian Embassy and four days later to Delhi.<br>The rest, of course, is history, as the tri-partite Delhi Agreement paved the way for an interim government and move towards a democratic Nepal. We won\u2019t give away any spoilers, but we learn about Erika\u2019s role in getting Tribhuvan to meet the Indian ambassadors and carry a letter from Nehru.<br>This is all stuff that could be turned into a gripping historical tv series like The Crown for which Erika Leuchtag has already written the script.<br>Excerpts:<br>King Tribhuvan was curious about Senior Queen\u2019s physiotherapy treatment and wanted the same treatment for himself too. Here, Erika describes King Tribhuvan's physique in intimate details:<br>He took off the dressing gown. Beneath it, he wore black and white bathing trunks, and his body was as superbly muscled and as graceful as that of the dancing deity Nata Raja. About his hips, and dipping down toward his loins, was a broad belt of thin golden mesh, fastened in the centre by a clip mouthed with a great emerald. Around the biceps of his right arm he writhed a golden snake, it's head a milky moonstone. From his throat, hung amulets strung to threads of gold and emeralds.<br>From neck to ankle he was tattooed, twisting, cunning convolutions of blue lace of his pale skin. The intricate patterns combined on his chest, thighs and shoulders to form ferns, flowers and the outstretched beauty of peacock\u2019s feathers.<br>A letter from King Tribhuvan to Erika Leuchtag where he has given due credit to Erika's effort through coded words:<br>\u2018Dear Miss Lakshmi -- I thank you for your advice -- be still more grave. I will try very much to be grave. The photo of Lakshmi is in my portico, the reflection is in my heart. Do not forget us.<br>The bird came to my garden and gave me the Doctor's flower, but you are the person who sowed the seed and took care of the plant. The flower is very sweet and beautiful. What more? Not only I, but all my party offer you our heartfelt thanks for the trouble you have taken to plant and make it free from pest.\u2019<br>In a conversation with Indian Ambassador CPN Singh during a picnic trip to Budhanilkantha, Erika Leuchtag writes about a conversation with his predecessor:<br>I told him that Surjit had met the King, and that he had promised to help, even by flying the King out of Nepal to asylum in India, but this had come to nothing with Surjit's recall.<br>Chandreshwar Prasad Narain Singh: \"I should meet your King, also, although I cannot promise to fly him out of the country. But first tell me what it is he wants from India. I shall be going to India soon. Perhaps I could talk to Pandit-ji (Jawaharlal Nehru) and perhaps bring a letter back for your King.\u201d<br>Erika and the King<br>(With a King in the Clouds)",

            "description": "Novel Taap is written by Sharda Sharma.<br>Taap refers to the power of scorching heat or the power gained from struggle. Another thing is that people learn and experience Taap from the lessons learned from the struggles of their lives, suffering from the supernatural, material and spiritual. As the Taap subsides, people are still gaining energy. That is why it is said that life is struggle, struggle is life. The experiences of a character in the course of his life are the subject matter of a novel. Basically, this novel seeks to highlight various aspects of feminism. As the author is also a woman, the issues of feminism are significant and she has also highlighted the male tendency. The disgusting deeds of a man in a dignified position like a minister are expressed through a novel. Evidence of how inferior a person can be without regard to his position is evident in the novel.<br>Although the author is a woman, she seems to have studied male tendencies very deeply. The important aspect of the novel is that it easily presents the male attitude. We have got the impression that such characters in the recent Nepali political sky also belong to Salva.<br>One of the characters in the novel develops hatred towards people while living, and, the conclusion of those characters towards people is as follows: - 'Perhaps people are animals with the mask of civilization.' It can be done. Sharma's collection of travel essays on 'Land of Flowers' is also excellent. Considering the uniqueness of her writing, Sharma can be counted among the top five women writers in Nepali literature.",
